My portfolio of AI agents and automation workflows using n8n, Make, and OpenAI
# Vishnu ‚Äì AI Agent & Workflow Automation Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of real-world automation workflows I‚Äôve built using no-code tools like **n8n**, **Make**, and **OpenAI GPT-4**.

Each workflow solves practical business problems such as email automation, WhatsApp bots, CRM syncing, resume screening, document Q&A systems, and customer support.
